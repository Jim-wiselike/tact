This directory contains scripts that should be implemented by any test because
they will be run by TACT.

You can override some scripts from ../../../bin (same as $APP_DIR/bin)
or you may not implement some of these scripts if they are implemented in $APP_DIR/bin

Every script can use two environment variables: TEST_DIR and APP_DIR
For example thhis readme file is in $TEST_DIR/bin
($APP_DIR is somenthing like a reference to a base class and $TEST_DIR corresponds to 'this')

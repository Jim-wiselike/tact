This directory contains scripts that should be implemented by any test because
they will be run by TACT.

These scripts are intended to be common for all tests for one application.
You can override some of these scripts in tests/my-test/bin (same as $TEST_DIR/bin)

Every script can use two environment variables: TEST_DIR and APP_DIR
For example thhis readme file is in $APP_DIR/bin
($APP_DIR is somenthing like a reference to a base class and $TEST_DIR corresponds to 'this')
